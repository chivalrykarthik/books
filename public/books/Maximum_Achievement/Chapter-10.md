# Chapter 10: Mastering Personal Relationships

## Chapter Overview
This chapter explores the deep connection between personal relationships and overall success in life. It explains that your ability to build and maintain loving, intimate relationships is a direct measure of your maturity and happiness. The chapter presents practical wisdom on what makes relationships work, why they fail, and how to repair them. It emphasizes that your relationships are a reflection of who you really are inside, and that no success in public life can compensate for failure at home.

## Narrative Summary

### The Foundation of All Success
Your choice of a mate and the quality of your home life determine your success as a human being more than any other factor. This is because your outer world of relationships will always correspond exactly to your inner world of thoughts and feelings. If your inner world is positive and loving, your outer relationships will be happy and satisfying.

> *"No success in public life can compensate for failure in the home."* — Benjamin Disraeli reminds us that personal relationships should take precedence over everything else.

The statistics are sobering. Socially isolated people are two to three times more likely to die prematurely. Divorced men die from heart disease, cancer, and strokes at double the rate of married men. The health consequences of poor relationships are real and serious. If for no other reason than your desire to live a long and happy life, you must be serious about building excellent relationships.

### The Self-Esteem Connection
Everything in relationships begins with self-esteem—how much you like and respect yourself. Self-esteem has two parts: the emotional component (how you feel about yourself) and the performance-based component (how well you feel you perform in important areas).

There is a direct relationship between the quality of your relationships and your level of self-esteem. You can only like yourself to the degree that you fully accept yourself. And how much you like yourself is largely determined by how much you feel you are accepted by other people.

### The Path to Self-Acceptance
To reach self-acceptance, you must first develop self-awareness. You need to understand why you think, feel, and act the way you do. Only when you achieve a higher level of self-awareness can you move to self-acceptance.

Self-awareness, in turn, is based on self-disclosure. You only truly understand yourself to the degree that you can disclose or share yourself with at least one other person. This means telling someone you trust completely exactly what you are thinking and feeling, with no fear of disapproval or rejection.

> *"If everyone learned to really listen to other people, 75 percent of the psychotherapists in the United States would be out of work by next Wednesday."* — This highlights how powerful honest listening and disclosure can be.

The great emotional problem of our time is guilt—guilt that arises from destructive criticism and past mistakes. You can begin to free yourself from these negative feelings by telling someone else what you did or said. This form of catharsis, or cleansing, liberates you and allows you to get on with the rest of your life.

### Intimacy and Personal Growth
One of the purposes of marriage and intimate relationships is to give you the opportunity to evolve and grow to your full capacity. In a fully trusting relationship, you feel free to tell the other person things you have done in the past and what you are thinking and feeling in the present. This sharing develops a deeper understanding of your own humanity and makes you more tolerant and compassionate.

Everyone needs to be loved and accepted unconditionally by at least one other person. Love is like money: if you have an ample supply, you don't think about it very much. But if your supply is cut off, you think about nothing else.

> *"The cruelest punishment inflicted on prisoners is locking them away from all other human beings—putting them in solitary confinement."* — This shows how essential human connection is to our wellbeing.

### Six Rules for Successful Relationships

#### Rule 1: Similarities Attract
You will always be happiest and most compatible with another person whose interests, tastes, and values are similar to yours. The most important areas of similarity are:
- Attitudes toward money (how it's earned, saved, and spent)
- Attitudes regarding children (whether to have them, how many, how to raise them)
- Attitudes toward sex
- Religion
- Political and social issues
- How to spend leisure time
- Spiritual matters

Most unhappiness in marriages comes down to fundamental disagreements about these basic issues of life.

#### Rule 2: Opposites Attract (But Only in Temperament)
Nature demands balance and harmony. While you need similar values, you need opposite temperaments for balance.

There is a simple test called "the conversation test." In a temperamentally compatible relationship, there will be an easy ebb and flow of conversation. Each person can talk as much as they need and listen as much as they need. When you are balanced, 90 percent of your time together will be filled with easy conversation, and the other 10 percent with comfortable silences.

If both people need to talk 70 percent of the time, there will be a constant struggle over "air time." In this type of relationship, there will always be one person who loves more and one who loves less. The person who loves more will give in and suppress their need to talk, which eventually leads to frustration and unhappiness.

#### Rule 3: Total Commitment
Total commitment requires a heartfelt determination to make the relationship successful. A total commitment means that neither party ever considers or discusses the possibility of separating, breaking up, or divorcing.

> *"Love is the total commitment to the full development of the potential of the other."* — W. Scott Peck's definition shows that true love means wanting your partner to fulfill their full potential.

Many people avoid total commitment because they've been hurt before. They keep their options open as an emotional escape route. But this lack of commitment creates the exact situation they fear—the relationship gradually deteriorates.

A wonderful truth about human beings is that we are free emotionally only when we have given up all other options and committed ourselves wholeheartedly to one other person.

#### Rule 4: Liking Matters More Than Love
It is more important and more satisfying to genuinely like your partner than to be in love. In a long-term relationship, people may fall in and out of love, but if the two people like and respect each other, the relationship can endure indefinitely.

In the ideal relationship, your mate will be your best friend. There will be no one in the world that you would rather be with, share with, talk to, or spend time with than your spouse. In every interview with couples who have been together for a long time, both describe the other as their very best friend in the world.

The amount of laughter in a relationship is a measure of its health. When two people are ideally suited, they laugh a lot together, and at the same things.

#### Rule 5: Similar Self-Concepts Attract
You will always be attracted to and most compatible with a person who is just about as happy and positive as you are. People with negative self-concepts will be attracted to each other, just as people with positive self-concepts will be.

The general tone of the relationship—the level of optimism versus pessimism—is a good measure of compatibility. One study found that four out of five divorces in America are initiated by women who are "mad as hell and not going to take it anymore." Many feel they are being held back by the negativity of their spouses.

#### Rule 6: Good Communications Are Essential
The primary reason for success in marriages is that the two partners communicate well. They are on the same wavelength. Each can sense what the other is feeling and thinking.

The primary reason for failure is poor communication. The couple misunderstands each other and continually argues. To build quality communications, you require both high quantity and high quality of unbroken time with each other. Couples need to be alone together, spending long stretches talking and listening.

### Understanding Gender Differences
Men and women have distinctly different communication styles. Generally, men are direct and women are indirect. Men are more focused on results and completion, while women are more concerned about relationships and the process of communication.

For example, when a woman asks "Honey, are you thirsty?" she may really be saying "I am thirsty; why don't we stop and get something to drink?" But a man will answer directly about whether he is thirsty, missing her indirect communication completely.

For men, shopping is a simple process with an expected result—get in, buy it, get out. For many women, shopping is a process, even a recreational and social activity. The conversation that takes place is as important as what she buys.

When a woman discusses a problem, she usually doesn't want a solution or advice. What she wants is an opportunity to discuss the situation, to process the problem through dialogue. She probably already knows what she's going to do. What she seeks is communication.

### Ask Her About Her Day
One of the best things a man can do is to ask his partner about her day before volunteering anything about his own day. The first time he does this, she will probably be shocked and give a brief, dismissive answer. He must persist, asking questions like a detective about details of her morning, lunch, afternoon, and so on.

> *"Remember, it is not the content of the conversation that is important. It is the process."* — Expressing genuine interest and listening carefully deepens understanding and improves communication.

### The Key Question
The most important question to ask and answer continually to maintain a successful relationship is: **"What's important here?"**

What's important is not winning the argument or being right, but maintaining the quality of the relationship. What's important is that you continue to love and respect each other and live together in peace and harmony.

Practice the golden rule: Ask yourself regularly, "What would it be like to be married to me?" If you do to your mate what you would like done to you, and refrain from doing what you wouldn't like, you will be far more aware of the impact of your words and behavior.

### Six Problems in Relationships and How to Solve Them

#### Problem 1: Lack of Commitment
This is evident in the "go halfway" relationship. Instead of full commitment, one or both say "You go halfway and I'll go halfway." But as soon as one party decides to go only 49 percent, a split opens. The parties dig in, going 48 percent, then 40, then 30, until someone stops trying altogether.

Examples include couples who keep separate bank accounts and divide expenses equally, counting every dollar. Or couples who live together for years, labeling every item in their apartment to indicate who owns what, unconsciously planning their eventual separation.

The solution: Commit yourself completely to the relationship. Get in with both feet. Never consider the possibility of the relationship failing.

#### Problem 2: Trying to Change the Other Person
This is a subtle form of rejection, another way of saying "You are not good enough for me the way you are." Whenever you try to change another person, you ignite feelings of anger and resentment.

> *"What you sees is what you gets."* — Flip Wilson's wisdom reminds us that people don't change very much.

The solution: Simply accept the person as he or she is. If you cannot accept their behavior and personality, that should tell you something about compatibility. Sometimes, paradoxically, when you stop trying to change them and just accept them unconditionally, they may begin to change on their own.

#### Problem 3: Jealousy
Jealousy is always experienced in the mind and heart of the person feeling the emotion. It is a terrible negative emotion that arises from feelings of low self-esteem and personal inadequacy. The jealous person feels "Nobody could ever really love me, being the kind of person I am."

The antidote: Realize that jealousy has nothing to do with the other person. It has to do only with low self-esteem. Work on building self-esteem by saying over and over, "I like myself, I like myself, I like myself." When your self-esteem is high enough, nothing anyone else does will make you doubt your own personal value.

#### Problem 4: Self-Pity
This occurs when you feel sorry for yourself for something your partner has either done or not done. The solution is not to get your partner to change their behavior. The antidote is to get so busy with your own goals that you don't have time to feel sorry for yourself.

You are responsible for your own emotions. Nobody makes you feel anything. Self-pity is based on the mistaken notion that someone else is responsible for making you happy.

#### Problem 5: Negative Expectations
These occur when you constantly expect the other person to disappoint you. Your expectations tend to be fulfilled.

The solution: Always expect the best of your partner. Perhaps the most wonderful words one person can say to another are: **"I love you, and I believe in you."** Always tell your partner that you have complete confidence and faith in their ability to do anything they put their mind to.

#### Problem 6: Incompatibility
This is perhaps the most common reason why people are unhappy in marriages. Usually when two people meet and fall in love, they are attracted by things they have in common. But as years pass and they change, they often grow in different directions, developing new interests, tastes, and opinions.

The most common time for incompatibility to occur is between ages twenty-eight and thirty-two. If a couple gets married in their early twenties, by the end of their twenties they may find they have very little in common.

**Warning signs:**
1. The laughter goes out of the relationship
2. The conversation dries up—they have little to talk about
3. Each person preoccupies themselves with work, children, or something else to avoid going home

### How to Put the Love Back In
Love is a verb—an action word. "To love" requires that you do the things that a loving person would do. You may be able to act your way back into loving the person you have fallen out of love with.

The Greek word for this process is **Praxis**. The Principle of Praxis states that you generate emotions in yourself by doing things consistent with those emotions over and over until they kindle into flames.

You can put the love back into your relationship by doing the things you did during courtship. Start being more caring, attentive, understanding, and sympathetic. As you act the part of a loving spouse, your feelings may begin to change for the better. Look for the good qualities you once admired, forgive past mistakes, and really want to rebuild the relationship.

### When It Can't Be Saved
Sometimes the fire has gone out completely. There is no longer any desire to make the emotional sacrifices necessary to save the relationship. The two parties have become incompatible.

The best thing to do is simply accept it. William James said, **"The first step in dealing with any difficulty is to be willing to have it so."** Much unhappiness and illness is caused by denial—refusing to face the fact that something is wrong.

Ask yourself: "Is this a fact, or is this a problem?" If it's a problem, it's amenable to a solution. But if it's a fact, the smartest thing is to accept it. Many people cause themselves enormous unhappiness by confusing the fact of incompatibility with the problem of incompatibility.

The reason you enter a relationship is to be happier inside the relationship than you would be outside of it. An unhappy relationship robs you of your happiness and undermines your potential more surely than any other single factor.

### What Others Will Think
Many people stay in bad relationships because they are afraid of what others might say. They force themselves to keep up appearances while being bitterly unhappy behind closed doors.

The fact is that **no one else really cares** about your relationship as much as you do. Most people have so many problems of their own that they have very little time to think about you. Even close friends and family spend most of their time thinking about themselves. When you finally decide to leave an unhappy relationship, your decision will have virtually no effect on the people around them.

The bottom line: The most foolish thing you can do is stay in a bad relationship because you think it will hurt someone else if you leave. The smartest thing is to be perfectly selfish emotionally. If you are not happy and cannot save the situation, then at least please yourself.

> *"You can never make anyone else happy by being miserable yourself. Only happy people can make others happy."* — Never sacrifice yourself on the altar of someone else's happiness.

### Love Is the Most Important Thing
The security and joy of a loving relationship is perhaps the most wonderful thing a man and woman can experience. You should do everything possible to build and maintain a loving relationship, including listening, expressing gratitude and appreciation, and treating the other person with kindness, courtesy, gentleness, patience, and compassion.

But if it doesn't work out, have the courage and character to accept that nothing in human life is either perfect or permanent. Have the honesty to accept that the kindest thing you can do for someone else is to achieve your own happiness.
