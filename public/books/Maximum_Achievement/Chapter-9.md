## Narrative Summary (Storytelling Style)

### The Power of Social Intelligence

The most important and most highly paid form of intelligence in America is social intelligence—the ability to get along well with other people. Fully 85 percent of your success in life will be determined by your social skills, by your ability to interact positively and effectively with others and get them to cooperate with you in achieving your goals.

Learning to develop and maintain superior human relationships can do more for your career and personal life than perhaps anything else you can accomplish.

Here's the sobering reality: the inability to get along with others is the primary reason for failure, frustration, and unhappiness in life and work. According to one study, more than 95 percent of people let go from their jobs over a ten-year period were fired because of poor social skills rather than lack of competence or technical ability.

As psychologist Sydney Jourard observed, most of your joy in life comes from happy relationships with other people, and most of your problems come from unhappy relationships with them. Most of your problems in life are people problems.

The good news? You can become extremely skilled at getting along with others.

### What Makes a Healthy Personality

There are three powerful measures of a healthy personality:

**First**, your personality is healthy to the degree that you deliberately look for the good in each person and situation. An unhealthy personality looks for the bad—criticizing and complaining about others.

**Second**, your personality is healthy to the degree that you can freely forgive people who have hurt you. Most unhappiness and psychosomatic illness is caused by the inability to forgive, the insistence on holding grudges long after incidents have passed. The very act of forgiving has a liberating influence on your personality. Truly healthy people do not hate. They keep their minds clear of old problems. They let them go.

**Third**, your personality is healthy to the degree that you can get along easily with many different kinds of people. Anybody can get along with a few people—those who are very much like them. But the truly healthy person has an easy ability to get along with a great variety of people with different temperaments, personalities, attitudes, values, and opinions.

There is a direct relationship between self-esteem and the health of your personality:

> *"The more you like and respect yourself, the more you like and respect others."*

The more you accept yourself just as you are, the more you accept others just as they are. Men and women with high self-esteem can get along with almost anyone, anywhere, in almost any situation. Those with low self-esteem can only get along with a few people, and not for very long.

### The Law of Indirect Effort

One of the most powerful principles for improving relationships is the Law of Indirect Effort. This law states that you get almost everything in your relationships more easily by approaching them indirectly rather than directly.

**Want to impress people?** The direct way is to talk about your own admirable qualities. But this usually makes you feel foolish and embarrassed. The indirect way is simply to be impressed by the other person. The more you are impressed by who they are or what they've accomplished, the more likely they will be impressed by you.

**Want someone interested in you?** The direct way is to tell them all about yourself. The indirect way is to become genuinely interested in them. The more interested you become in another person, the more likely they will become interested in you.

**Want to be happy?** The direct way is to do whatever you think will make you happy. But the most enjoyable and lasting form of happiness comes from making someone else happy. Whenever you do or say anything that makes someone else happy, you feel happy yourself.

**Want respect?** Express respect. When you show respect or admiration for another person, they feel respect and admiration for you. This is the Principle of Reciprocity—whenever you do something nice for someone, they want to reciprocate.

Here's the most important application of this law: everything you do to another person has a reciprocal effect on yourself. Everything you do to raise the self-esteem of another person raises your own self-esteem at the same time, and in the same measure.

> *"I like you because of the way I feel about myself when I am with you."*

This line contains the key to excellent human relations. The most successful and happy people are those who make others feel good about themselves. When you go through life raising the self-esteem of others, opportunities will open before you, and people will help you in ways you cannot now imagine.

---

### Make Others Feel Important

The key to applying the Law of Indirect Effort is simply to make others feel important. Everything you do or say that makes another feel more important boosts their self-esteem and increases your own in equal measure.

When you go throughout your day looking for ways to make others feel important, you will be popular and welcome everywhere. You will be healthier, happier, and get more real satisfaction from life.

### Building Self-Esteem in Others: Stop Tearing It Down

The starting point of raising others' self-esteem is to stop tearing it down. Immediately stop doing or saying anything that lowers another's self-esteem. At the very least, be neutral. Keep silent.

**Destructive criticism** of any kind lowers self-esteem faster than any other behavior. More relationships and personalities are damaged or ruined by destructive criticism than by all other negative influences combined. Destructive criticism attacks the core of human personality, triggering feelings of guilt, inferiority, and undeservingness.

When a person is criticized—even with so-called "constructive criticism"—they immediately feel angry and defensive and want to strike back. By the Law of Reciprocity, whenever you hurt others, especially their self-esteem, you make them want, or even need, to get even.

Perhaps the best decision you can ever make is to stop criticizing other people. Eliminate destructive criticism from your vocabulary and conversations. Become a positive person by only saying things that build people up rather than tearing them down.

Most people are doing the very best they can with what they have. Very few people make mistakes deliberately. When someone makes a mistake, they already feel incompetent—their self-esteem drops. No one does this to themselves on purpose.

Most criticism comes from judging and blaming, from setting yourself up as superior. But judging others triggers the Law of Sowing and Reaping—it causes others to judge you more critically.

**Complaining** is another behavior that undermines self-esteem in both speaker and listener. Many people slip into playing "Ain't it awful"—constantly finding things to complain about, then trying to "one-up" each other with something worse.

As Henry Ford said: "Never complain, never explain."

The habit of complaining attracts other complainers into your life. By the Law of Concentration—whatever you dwell upon grows in your reality—the more you complain, the more you find to complain about.

Real men and women never complain. If there's something they can do about a problem, they take action. If there's nothing they can do, they say, "What cannot be cured must be endured," and get busy doing what they can.

The truth is, no one is really interested in your complaints anyway. About 80 percent of people don't care about your complaints, and the other 20 percent are kind of glad you've got them.

Resolve to halt all criticizing, condemning, and complaining. As the song says: "If you can't say something nice, don't speak at all, is my advice."

## Seven Keys to Improving Relationships

There are seven positive, constructive, psychologically sound behaviors you can practice to improve the way you get along with other people. Each appeals to the deep subconscious needs of others—their needs to feel important, valued, and respected.

---

### 1. Be Agreeable

People like to be around agreeable individuals with whom they can freely and easily discuss a great variety of subjects. When you nod, smile, and agree with a person who is talking, they feel more valuable and respected.

Agreeable behavior raises the self-esteem of others. Disagreement lowers it. Whenever you disagree or argue, you're challenging their knowledge and intelligence—telling them their judgment and experience aren't worth much.

We hate to be wrong, and never more so than when it's obvious. Being wrong on an issue makes us feel that we ourselves are somehow wrong. Our self-esteem takes a beating.

> *"Agree with thine adversary quickly."*

If the other person is obviously wrong based on your knowledge of the facts, ask yourself: "How important is this?" If it's not important, rather than disagreeing, let it pass.

**A story of personal transformation**: Growing up, Tracy became a great arguer—arguing with anybody about anything. He would become well-informed on subjects just to know more than whoever he was arguing with. With superior information, he almost always "won."

But soon he found himself spending a lot of time alone. People deliberately avoided him. He was winning all the arguments but losing all the friends.

> *"A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still."*

He had forgotten to ask: "What's important here?" The relationships were what mattered—not being right or winning arguments. Always ask yourself: "Do I want to be right or do I want to be happy?" Choose happiness.

If something is so important you cannot let it pass, use **"third-party disagreement."** Put your argument into the mouth of an imaginary or non-present person. Say, "That's a very interesting point, Bill, but if someone were to ask this question, how would you answer it?" This allows you to remain agreeable while raising important concerns.

---

### 2. Practice Acceptance

Each of us is conditioned from infancy to seek acceptance from others. The infant looks into the face of their mother or father to see if they are loved, respected, wanted. As we grow, we continue looking into others' faces to see how we're doing.

When two people meet, the first thing that must be established is a certain level of acceptance. We look into the eyes, smile, face, and body language of the other person to see if they accept us and are happy with our presence. Only when we feel accepted can we relax.

**How do you express acceptance? Simply smile.** It takes only 13 muscles to smile and 112 muscles to frown. A genuine smile says: "I accept you as you are, unconditionally." When you smile at another person, they feel valuable, important, and worthwhile.

A Chinese proverb says: "A man without a smile should not open a shop."

Even when you don't feel like smiling, you can act your way into feeling. If you force yourself to smile genuinely at people for just a few minutes, you will begin to feel better. The clouds of negativity will break up and blow away.

---

### 3. Express Appreciation

One of the deepest cravings of human nature is the need to be appreciated. Whenever you express gratitude or appreciation toward another person for anything they've done, you make them feel more valuable, competent, and worthwhile.

All it takes to express appreciation are the simple words: **"thank you."** These are two of the most powerful words in the English language—and the most powerful single expression in virtually any language.

Having traveled and worked in more than eighty countries, Tracy learned that you can get halfway across any country by simply learning and saying "please" and "thank you" everywhere you go.

**Develop the habit**: Say "thank you" to everybody for anything and everything they do. Thank your spouse for everything. Thank your children. The more you thank them, the more positive and happy they feel—and the more eager to do things that trigger your appreciation.

**Send thank-you notes.** When you send a note to someone, even with just a few words, they often remember you positively for months or even years. You can set yourself apart by becoming known for the different ways you express gratitude.

Develop an **"attitude of gratitude."** The happiest and most popular people go through life being genuinely grateful for everything that happens to them and everyone they meet. An attitude of gratitude clears a path before you and guarantees a healthy personality. The more thankful you are for what you have, the more things you will have to be thankful for.

---

### 4. Express Approval (Praise)

Little children cry for it; grown men die for it. The expression of approval, or praise, is one of the fastest and most predictable ways to make people feel happy and proud.

One definition of self-esteem is how much a person considers themselves "praiseworthy." Whenever someone receives praise, their self-esteem goes up like a thermometer on a hot day.

Ken Blanchard, author of *The One Minute Manager*, recommends "one minute praisings" throughout the day. He recommends that you "catch people doing something right." The more you do, the more effective and competent they feel, and the more likely they are to repeat the praised behavior.

Tired children who are praised actually perk up and recover lost energy. There is almost nothing that has greater power to raise self-esteem than sincere praise.

**Three Keys to Positive Praising:**

1. **Praise immediately.** The sooner you praise, the greater the impact. Praise long after the incident has little effect.

2. **Praise specifically.** Instead of "You're doing a great job," say "You did an excellent job getting that report out on Thursday." Specific praise ensures the specific behavior is repeated.

3. **Praise in public.** If you must correct, correct in private—but praise in front of others. The more people present when you praise someone, the more it boosts their self-esteem. Awards and recognition given before large audiences have the greatest impact.

> *"People may work harder for more money, but they will crawl over broken glass to get more praise and recognition."*

Napoleon said: "I have discovered a remarkable thing; men will die for ribbons."

**Two kinds of praising:**

- **Continuous reinforcement**: Praise every single time to establish a new habit
- **Intermittent reinforcement**: Once the habit is established, praise every third or fourth time to keep it "locked in"

---

### 5. Express Admiration

Whenever you admire another person for something they've accomplished, some personality trait, or some possession, you raise their self-esteem. As Abraham Lincoln said: "Everybody likes a compliment."

**You can admire:**

- **Personality traits**: Punctuality, generosity, persistence, determination. We are all proud of our positive traits and what we've become.

- **Possessions**: People invest emotion in what they acquire—furniture, homes, clothes. Complimenting a person's home or living room never goes wrong. For women, any article of clothing or accessories. For men, especially their shoes or tie—they spend a lot of time selecting these.

- **Accomplishments**: Education, positions achieved, businesses built. Admiring accomplishments raises self-esteem and makes people feel good about you.

**One note of caution**: Only express appreciation, approval, or admiration when you genuinely feel it. Never be insincere. People are like human lie detectors—they can detect insincerity across a crowded room. If they feel you're trying to manipulate them, their self-esteem goes down and they react with distrust and defensiveness.

There's only one exception: An insincere smile is better than a sincere frown any time.

---

### 6. Pay Attention (The "White Magic" of Listening)

Life is the study of attention. You always give your attention to what you most value, what most interests you, what is most important to you. Your attention is your life.

In relationships, the amount of attention you pay to others is the chief indicator of how important they are to you. The opposite of attention is indifference—you ignore people you neither value nor appreciate.

When you pay attention, you're saying: "I value you and consider you important." When you ignore someone, you're saying: "I consider you unimportant and of little value."

**How do you pay proper attention?** You practice the "white magic" of listening. Listening is the true measure of attention in human relations.

**Three Benefits of Becoming a Good Listener:**

1. **Listening builds trust.** When someone listens to us, we trust them more. The fastest way for two people to build trust is for each to listen attentively and appreciatively to the other.

2. **Listening builds self-esteem.** When you listen carefully to a person, their self-esteem goes up. Whenever anyone listens to you carefully, you feel more important and valuable.

3. **Listening builds self-discipline.** It requires tremendous personal mastery and self-control to listen attentively. The average person speaks at about 150 words per minute, while you can listen at almost 600 words per minute. Active listening requires you to control your attention and stay focused.

---

### The Five Parts of Active Listening

**1. Listen attentively.** Face the speaker directly, not at an angle. Lean slightly forward. If standing, shift your weight onto the balls of your feet so your energy projects forward. Watch the speaker's mouth and eyes closely. This tells them you're paying complete attention.

**2. Listen without interrupting.** Most people don't really listen—they're busy thinking about what they'll say when the other person takes a breath. When a speaker senses the listener is just waiting to jump in, they feel irritated and often insulted. Listen patiently, calmly, as if there's nothing else in the world you'd rather hear.

**3. Pause before replying.** When the speaker finishes, pause for three to five seconds before saying anything. Three things happen:
- You actually hear and understand them better
- You avoid interrupting if they were just collecting their thoughts
- Your silence shows you consider their words important—a great compliment

**4. Question for clarification.** Ask questions to ensure you fully understand. "Errant assumptions lie at the root of every failure." Use: "How do you mean?" or "How do you mean, exactly?" You can never ask this question without getting greater clarity.

Use open-ended questions that cannot be answered with "yes" or "no"—questions beginning with What, Why, When, How, Where, and Who. These give you more opportunity to listen, build trust, and fully understand.

Remember: You never learn anything while your mouth is open. When speaking, you can only say what you already know. When listening, you can learn something new.

**5. Feed back their words.** Paraphrase what they said in your own words. This shows how closely you've been paying attention. Until you can feed back a speaker's meaning correctly, you haven't really understood.

Try: "Let me make sure I understand you. What you're saying is this..." Then feed it back in your own words.

---

### Empathic Listening

Empathic listening involves genuinely caring and acting as a sounding board, rather than trying to solve the other person's problems yourself.

There are two types of empathic listening:

**Simple reflection**: Rephrase what the speaker explicitly stated without adding anything. If someone says "I'm really worried," you simply say "You seem to be really worried."

**Interpretive reflection**: Go beyond restating to reflect the underlying message. "Something really seems to be bothering you about your work; could it be that your boss is putting too much pressure on you?"

With interpretive reflection, you can:
- Summarize and identify themes (anger, frustration)
- Paraphrase thoughts or feelings not stated but suspected to be the real message

**A personal example**: One day, Tracy's eighteen-month-old son Michael prompted his five-year-old daughter Christina to come crying: "I hate my brother."

Before understanding interpretive listening, he would have said: "Oh, no you don't, you love your brother." Instead, reacting to the unspoken message and understanding sibling rivalry, he said: "You feel that we are paying too much attention to your little brother and not paying enough attention to you, don't you?"

Christina broke into tears: "Yes, I sometimes feel that you love him more than you love me." She didn't hate Michael—she simply needed reassurance that they still loved her very much.

---

### The Boomerang Principle

The seventh way to raise others' self-esteem uses the boomerang principle: "Whatever genuine emotion you express toward any other person will boomerang back on you, sooner or later."

Shakespeare wrote: "The fragrance of the rose lingers on the hand that casts it."

Whenever you express a positive sentiment about someone else, it eventually comes back to you. If you express a negative thought, the same principle holds—so make sure what you say about others is what you want to have come back.

---

### The Art of Conversation

Everything discussed in this chapter shines forth at its best in the art of conversation—the easy give and take, the exchange of ideas, information, and opinions.

**Rules for Good Conversation:**

**1. Cue the subject to your listener.** Talk about subjects that interest them. Any subject is okay if it interests the person you're speaking with.

Great conversation openers:
- "What sort of work do you do?"
- "How did you get into that business anyway?"
- "And then what did you do?"

Be sensitive to the amount of interest shown. If they become fidgety or look away, change the subject.

**2. Take your turn.** No monologues. If you've talked for three minutes straight without question or comment from listeners, you're making a speech, not holding a conversation.

Taking your turn also means not interrupting—and when interrupted, the most polite (and hardest) thing to do is shut up. Don't go back and finish a story unless asked.

Good conversation has an easy ebb and flow, like the tide, rolling in and out. Each person has opportunity both to speak and listen.

**3. Think before you speak.** Avoid saying anything that would make someone uncomfortable, unhappy, or self-conscious. Be tactful and aware of others' sensitivities.

Benjamin Franklin wrote about how he transformed his personality and effectiveness by preceding opinions with phrases like "It seems to me that" or "Some people say that." Presenting opinions tentatively makes it easier for others to listen and appreciate your ideas.

**4. Respect privacy.** Keep questions general and impersonal. Give others the opportunity to decide whether to open up. Don't burden casual acquaintances with your troubles.

Remember Burnham's Law: "Everybody knows everything." Anything you tell anyone under any circumstances will eventually be known to everyone—especially the worst possible person you'd want to hear it. A "secret" is something you only tell one person at a time.

**5. Be natural.** Be yourself. Let your personality flow. Only say what you feel comfortable saying. If something inside tells you not to speak up, listen to your inner voice. Speak easily and spontaneously without trying to impress anyone.

The best conversationalists are those who are relaxed, positive, and completely natural.

### The Dale Carnegie Story

There's a famous story about Dale Carnegie being invited to a New York party honoring a wealthy woman who had just returned from Africa.

When introduced, the woman said: "Oh, Mr. Carnegie, I have heard that you are one of the finest conversationalists in New York. Is that true?"

Carnegie replied: "Thank you very much, madam. And I have heard that you have just returned from a trip to Africa. Why did you decide to go to Africa?"

He then asked: "Who did you take?" "When did you go?" "When did you return?" "Where did you go in Africa?" "How did you get there?" "What exactly did you do there?"

They conversed for about twenty minutes—she spoke 95 percent of the time answering his questions. The next day, in the social pages of a New York newspaper, she was quoted as saying: "Mr. Dale Carnegie is surely one of the finest conversationalists in New York."

You too can become a brilliant conversationalist by learning how to speak and, especially, by learning how to listen.

### The Secret of Relationships

Getting along well with others is perhaps the most important thing you ever learn to do. Growing up, Tracy was very unpopular with few friends—mostly social misfits like himself. This inability to behave so that people wanted to be around him cast a shadow over his early years until he learned the great secret:

You can become popular and likable by doing two things:

**First**, get out of yourself and get into the lives and concerns of others. Become genuinely interested in them. Ask questions and listen. Think of ways to help them. Practice the law of sowing and reaping: Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.

**Second**, get busy working on yourself and your goals. Develop your unique talents. Get good at what you do. The better you do the things important to you, the more you like yourself. And the more you like and respect yourself, the more comfortable and effective you are with others.

> *"Nothing succeeds like success."*

Visualize, affirm, and act the part. Work on yourself as if your future depended upon it—because it does. You can become one of the most positive and effective people in your world when you put these ideas to work in all your relationships.
