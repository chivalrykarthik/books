# Chapter 12: Mastery: The Power of Love

## Chapter Overview
This final chapter explores the ultimate secret of human existence and the most powerful force in the universe: love. It argues that love is the central requirement for a happy, healthy, and successful life. The chapter integrates the previous mental laws, showing how they all depend on love, and provides a roadmap for moving from self-love to the love of others, and finally to universal love. It is a call to action to make love an active verb in your daily life.

## Mastery: The Power of Love

### The Foundation of everything
The author begins with a personal journey, questioning the meaning of life. After traveling the world and meeting people from every walk of life, the conclusion is always the same: **love is the most important thing in the world**.
Emotional maturity can be measured by how readily a person admits this truth. Even the most successful business people or politicians will admit, in private, that love matters more than their achievements. All the ingredients of success discussed in Chapter 1—peace of mind, health, energy, and financial achievement—depend entirely on the amount of love you have for yourself and others.

### Love and the Mental Laws
Love is not just an emotion; it is the fuel for the mental laws that govern our reality:
*   **Law of Belief:** If you love yourself, you believe in your potential and achieve more.
*   **Law of Attraction:** Loving thoughts attract loving people and happy circumstances into your life.
*   **Law of Correspondence:** Your outer world of relationships is a direct reflection of your inner world of love.
*   **Law of Substitution:** You can crowd out negative, fearful thoughts by consciously focusing your mind on love, patience, and forgiveness.

### The Great Robber: Fear
The opposite of love is fear. Fear is the "great robber" that steals our happiness and potential. It manifests as fear of failure, rejection, or not being good enough.
The Bible states, "Perfect love casteth out fear." This means that as you increase the amount of love in your life, you decrease the amount of fear. To reach your full potential, you must work to eliminate fear until you are afraid of nothing. Love is the solvent that dissolves fear.

### Starting with Self-Love
You cannot give what you do not have. Therefore, everything begins with **self-love**. 
> *"The amount of love and respect you have for others... is in direct proportion to how much love you have for yourself."*

You can build self-love just like building muscle:
1.  **Accept responsibility:** Stop making excuses and take charge of your life.
2.  **Set big goals:** Working toward something worthwhile raises your self-esteem.
3.  **Care for your body:** Diet and exercise make you feel better about yourself.
4.  **Affirmations:** Repeat "I like myself" 50 to 100 times a day until it programs your subconscious.

### The Three Kinds of Love
The ancient Greeks identified three distinct levels of love:
1.  **Eros (Self-love):** The foundation. If you are stuck here, you become narcissistic. But you must pass through healthy self-love to grow.
2.  **Filia (Love of others):** Friendship and companionship. Once you love yourself, you naturally reach out to love others.
3.  **Charis (Universal love):** The highest and rarest form. This is unconditional love for all mankind, found in figures like Jesus, Buddha, and Mother Teresa. This love has transformed the world more than any army or king.

### Love is an Active Verb
Love is not just a noun; it is an action. You don't just *feel* love; you *do* love.
> *"Love is not only the answer, but it is the cure for most of life’s problems."*

The **Law of Reversibility** teaches a powerful lesson: If you act lovingly, the feelings of love will follow. Even if a relationship feels cold, you can "act your way back into love" by treating the person exactly as you did when you were falling in love. The feelings will return because the action generates the emotion.

### The Power of Forgiveness
The biggest roadblock to love is negativity—anger, guilt, and resentment. To experience love, you must remove these blocks. The key is **forgiveness**.
Forgiveness is a selfish act; you do it to set *yourself* free. Holding a grudge is like letting someone live rent-free in your head. You must issue a "blanket pardon" to everyone who has ever hurt you. If you can't wish them well or do them a kindness, you haven't truly forgiven them yet.

### The True Test
It is easy to love lovable people. The true test of your character is your ability to respond with patience and kindness to difficult, obnoxious people.
> *"A gentle answer turneth away wrath."*

When you treat a difficult person with gentleness, you maintain your own emotional control and often witness a miracle: their anger dissolves in the face of your love.

### Conclusion: The Purpose of Life
The chapter concludes with a simple but profound command: **"With all thy getting, get love."**
Every loving act makes the world better and enriches your own life. Ultimately, only what is done with love will last. The author leaves the reader with a final wish for their success, happiness, and above all, love.

## Key Highlights
*   **Love is the Answer:** Whether defined by religion or psychology, love is the antidote to fear and the root of happiness.
*   **Self-Love First:** You cannot love others until you love yourself. High self-esteem is the launchpad for all other relationships.
*   **Fake It Till You Feel It:** Because actions create emotions, you can rekindle love in a relationship simply by acting as if you are deeply in love.
*   **Forgiveness is Freedom:** You cannot be happy while holding a grudge. Forgiveness releases you from the past.
*   **The Highest Standard:** Strive for *Charis*—universal kindness—even toward those who are difficult or unkind to you.
*   **The Final Truth:** In the end, only love remains. It is the secret of the ages and the true meaningfulness of life.

## Simple Meanings Glossary
*   **Eros:** A Greek term for self-interested or romantic love.
*   **Filia:** A Greek term for brotherly love or friendship.
*   **Charis:** A Greek term for universal, unconditional love or charity.
*   **Law of Reversibility:** The principle that acting a certain way can create the corresponding feeling.
