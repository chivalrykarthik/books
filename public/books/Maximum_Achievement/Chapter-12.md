# Chapter 12: Mastery: The Power of Love

When the author was a teenager, he thought deeply about the meaning of life. He asked himself why he was here and what the purpose of existence was. After traveling to over eighty countries and working many jobs, he concluded that **love is the most important thing in the world**.

He has asked many people—including business leaders and politicians—what they value most. He found that everyone, even those who seem focused on material things, believes in their heart that love is more important than anything else.

## Everything Depends Upon Love

In Chapter One, success was described as a mix of seven ingredients. Each of these depends on love:

1.  **Peace of mind:** You have this only to the degree that you love yourself and others.
2.  **Health and energy:** These depend on self-love and self-acceptance.
3.  **Loving relationships:** These exist only if you love yourself and express love to others.
4.  **Financial achievement:** Most self-made millionaires love what they do.
5.  **Goals:** If you love yourself, you will set high and worth-while goals.
6.  **Self-knowledge:** Loving yourself makes it easier to look inward and understand yourself.
7.  **Self-actualization:** You achieve fulfillment only to the degree that you love and accept yourself and others unconditionally.

## Relating Love to the "Laws"

Your life is shaped by how you think. Several mental laws explain the power of love:

*   **The Law of Belief:** If you love and believe in yourself, you will achieve more than if you doubt yourself.
*   **The Law of Expectations:** Expecting the best from yourself and others is a loving attitude that brings good results.
*   **The Law of Attraction:** Loving thoughts attract kind people and happy circumstances into your life.
*   **The Law of Correspondence:** If your inner nature is loving, your outer world will be happy and prosperous.
*   **The Law of Concentration:** Dwelling on loving thoughts helps you "grow" loving relationships.
*   **The Law of Substitution:** Focusing on love, patience, and forgiveness pushes out negative thoughts that harm your peace of mind.
*   **The Law of Superconscious Activity:** Continuously thinking about what you want (love, health, joy) brings those things into reality.

Love also teaches **nonresistance**. Responding to anger with kindness protects your own emotions and can help the other person become better.

## Love Is the Answer

You can never have too much love. Lack of love is the root of most problems, and love is the cure.

The Bible says, "God is love," and "perfect love casteth out fear." Fear is the great enemy of happiness—fear of failure, rejection, or not being good enough. Love dissolves fear. Your goal should be to reach a point where you are afraid of nothing, which happens when you are filled with love.

## Self-Love, The Beginning

Self-esteem is the foundation of a healthy personality. You can build it day by day:
*   Speak positively to yourself ("I like myself").
*   Visualize yourself at your best.
*   Associate with happy, optimistic people.

**The Law of Reversibility** states that actions lead to feelings. If you act lovingly toward yourself, you will soon feel loving toward yourself. Actions matter more than words.

### The Five Keys to Personal Achievement
To build the high self-esteem that makes everything else possible:
1.  **Accept yourself unconditionally:** Value your special qualities and accept yourself exactly as you are.
2.  **Accept complete responsibility:** Stop blaming others or making excuses. Being self-responsible builds self-worth.
3.  **Set worthwhile goals:** The act of setting big goals shows you believe in yourself.
4.  **Take good care of yourself physically:** Eating well, sleeping, and exercising improve your self-respect.
5.  **Repeat "I like myself":** Say this 50 to 100 times a day until it becomes a deep belief.

## Three Kinds of Love

The ancient Greeks identified three types of love:
1.  **Eros (Self-love):** This is the base. People with low self-esteem are stuck here, focused only on their own feelings.
2.  **Filia (Love of others):** Once you love yourself, you naturally turn outward to love and care for others.
3.  **Charis (Universal love):** This is love for all mankind. It is rare and powerful. Great figures like Jesus, Buddha, and St. Francis possessed this expansive love.

## Love Transforms the World

History's most influential figures are remembered for their love:
*   **Jesus** is known as the "Apostle of love" for his unconditional love.
*   **Buddha** inspires millions with his loving nature and teachings on overcoming fear.
*   **St. Francis of Assisi** loved all living creatures, even animals and insects.
*   **Dr. Albert Schweitzer** dedicated his life to "reverence for life" in Africa.
*   **Mother Teresa** is respected worldwide for her unconditional love for the poor and dying.

## Love Is an Active Verb

Love is not just a feeling; it is something you **do**.
*   **Praxis:** This Greek concept means the *practice* of an action creates the emotion.

You can create feelings of love by acting lovingly. If a relationship has cooled, you can restore the love by treating the person exactly as you did when you were first in love.

## The Key to Happiness

The happiest people are those who constantly show love and kindness.
There is a poem called "Abou Ben Adhem" about a man who asks an angel to write his name down as "one that loves his fellow men." The next night, the angel reveals that his name leads the list of those blessed by God.

## Sowing and Reaping

Love works on a reciprocal basis:
*   You cannot love yourself more than you love others.
*   Love grows only by sharing.
*   The more you give away, the more you have.

The cure for unhappiness is to help someone else. **Love is an active behavior.**

In the poem "How Do I Love Thee?", Elizabeth Barrett Browning describes loving someone to the "depth and breadth and height my soul can reach," showing that love covers every part of life.

## Negativity Is the Roadblock

Negative emotions—fear, anger, guilt, and resentment—block love. Many people hold onto past hurts for years, which makes them physically and mentally ill.

### Set Yourself Free
To clear your mind, you must **forgive everyone** who has ever hurt you.
*   Forgiveness is a **selfish act**—you do it to free *yourself*.
*   **The Test:** You know you have truly forgiven someone if you can do them a favor or send them a gift without negative feelings.

## The Greatest of These

First Corinthians, Chapter Thirteen, famously describes love:
*   Love is patient and kind.
*   Love is not envious or proud.
*   Love bears, believes, hopes, and endures all things.
*   Love never fails.

This passage teaches that becoming a totally loving person brings true understanding and joy.

## The Testing Time

The most important time to be loving is when you don't feel like it. When someone is difficult or obnoxious, it is often a cry for help. Responding with a gentle answer can change their behavior and protects your own emotional integrity.

## A Simple Question for Guidance

In the book *In His Steps*, the characters asked themselves one question before doing anything: **"What would Jesus do?"**
Asking what a truly honest, kind, and loving person would do in a situation can clear up misunderstandings and bring peace.

## Change Your World

You cannot change the world, but you can change **yourself**. You can become a role model by always choosing the loving way.
Use the **cognitive control method**: When you feel angry at someone, say "God bless him" or "God bless her." This neutralizes your anger and restores your calm.

## The Purpose of Life

The ultimate lesson is: **"With all thy getting, get love."**
Every loving act increases your self-love and improves the world.

Emmet Fox's poem "The Golden Gate" states:
*   Love casts out fear.
*   There is no difficulty love cannot conquer.
*   There is no disease love cannot heal.
*   If you love enough, you will be the happiest and most powerful being in the world.

To be successful and happy, you must learn and practice love. Your job is to live joyously by filling your mind with thoughts of love, compassion, and forgiveness.

> Only what’s done with love will last."
