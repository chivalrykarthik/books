# Chapter 1: Make Your Life a Masterpiece

## Chapter Overview

This opening chapter sets the stage for Brian Tracy's comprehensive system for achieving success and happiness. It begins with an inspiring declaration that we live in an "age of achievement" where more opportunities exist than ever before. Tracy shares his personal journey from a struggling, directionless youth to a successful executive and speaker, demonstrating that anyone can transform their life. The heart of the chapter introduces the **Seven Ingredients of Success**—a framework for defining what a truly fulfilling life looks like. The key message is simple yet profound: before you can achieve success, you must first define exactly what success means to you.

## Narrative Summary (Storytelling Style)

### The Age of Unlimited Possibility

We live in remarkable times. Never before in human history have so many people accomplished so much in so many different fields. The Western ideals of democracy, individual liberty, and free enterprise are spreading across the globe, creating unprecedented opportunities for prosperity and personal freedom.

This is the foundation upon which Tracy builds his message: no matter who you are or what your current situation looks like, you possess within you—right now, at this very moment—the ability to accomplish more than you ever have before. You can be, have, and do more than you've ever imagined. The only requirements are learning how and then putting that knowledge into action.

### Brian Tracy's Personal Story: From "Loser" to Leader

Tracy's own life serves as the ultimate proof of his principles. Born in Canada in 1944 to hardworking parents who never seemed to have enough money, he grew up hearing one phrase repeated endlessly: "We can't afford it." His parents, scarred by the Great Depression, lived in a constant state of financial anxiety.

As a teenager, Tracy became acutely aware that other families were doing far better than his own. They had nicer homes, newer clothes, better cars. This observation planted a seed that would grow into a lifelong question: **"Why is it that some people are more successful than others?"**

By his own admission, Tracy was a "loser" in his youth. He fooled around in class, ran with a bad crowd, and was always seeking attention in the wrong ways. He became so unpopular that parents and teachers used him as a warning to other children: "If you don't straighten up, you'll end up like Tracy."

Then, at sixteen, came the first revelation that changed everything:

> *"If I ever wanted things to change for me, then it was up to me to change."*

This simple but powerful realization—that no one else was coming to rescue him—launched his lifelong search for the principles of success.

After dropping out of high school and working as a laborer, Tracy saved money and set off to explore the world. He has since traveled to over eighty countries on six continents, experiencing both extreme poverty and remarkable success. He went from sleeping on the ground in foreign lands to dining with presidents and prime ministers, eventually becoming a senior executive of a $265 million development company.

### The First Principle: Clarity of Vision

Through all his experiences, Tracy discovered one of the most important lessons of success:

> *"You can't hit a target you can't see. You can't accomplish wonderful things with your life if you have no idea of what they are."*

Every successful person Tracy has met shares one common trait: they knew exactly what they wanted. They held a clear picture of their ideal life and accomplishments. This vision became a powerful motivator that drove them forward, and the realization of their goals seemed to flow naturally from establishing them in the first place.

Before setting specific goals, however, you must do something that very few people ever do: **decide exactly what "success" means to you.** You must decide what your life would look like if you made it into a masterpiece.

### Zero-Based Thinking: Starting Fresh

Tracy introduces a powerful mental technique called **"zero-based thinking."** Imagine you could go back to the beginning in every situation in your life and start over. Like holding up a picture frame and viewing different parts of your life through it, ask yourself this question:

*"If I had this decision to make today, knowing what I now know, what would I do?"*

The instruction here is critical: refuse to compromise on your answers. Be perfectly honest with yourself. Define your ideal in each situation before allowing yourself to get bogged down with all the reasons it isn't possible for you.

## The Seven Ingredients of Success

Tracy presents a comprehensive framework for understanding success. Anything you could ever want or consider important to your happiness falls into one of these seven categories. Your ideal life is a unique blending of these ingredients in the exact combination that makes you happiest.

---

### 1. Peace of Mind

The first and most important ingredient is **peace of mind**—the highest human good. Without it, nothing else has much value. You evaluate how well you are doing at any given time by how much inner peace you enjoy.

Think of peace of mind as your **internal gyroscope.** When you are living in harmony with your highest values and innermost convictions—when you are perfectly balanced in life—you enjoy peace of mind. The moment you compromise your values or go against your inner guidance, your peace of mind is the first thing to suffer.

Here's a wonderful truth: peace of mind is your normal, natural condition. Happiness is your birthright. It's not something you experience occasionally if you're lucky. It is central to your very existence.

Tracy shares his own evolution on this point. His religious background had taught him that his personal happiness was not a valid consideration—that happiness was merely a by-product of making others happy. The turning point came when he learned two crucial things:

1. **If you don't commit to achieving your own happiness, no one else will.** Trying to organize your life around making others happy is an unending exercise in frustration.

2. **You can't give away what you don't have.** You cannot make someone else happy by being miserable yourself.

The key to happiness is to systematically eliminate, or at least minimize, the parts of your life that cause negativity or stress. The major obstacle? Your attachment to the negative people and situations that cause unhappiness. Your rational mind comes up with clever reasons why you must continue in your existing situation, working frantically to keep you mired in your problems rather than solving them.

Tracy introduces **"mountaintop thinking"**—projecting forward in thought to imagine your ideal life. What combination of ingredients would have to exist for you to be perfectly happy? Free your mind from all limitations and be perfectly selfish. Define your life exactly as it would have to be for you to enjoy the peace of mind you desire.

> *"When you set peace of mind as your goal and plan everything you do in terms of whether it helps or hinders your attainment of that goal, you'll probably never make another mistake."*

---

### 2. Health and Energy

The second ingredient is **health and energy.** Just as peace of mind is your natural mental state, health and energy is your natural physical state.

Your body has a natural bias toward health. It produces energy easily and in abundance in the absence of mental or physical interference. Radiant health exists in the absence of pain, illness, or disease. Your body is constructed so remarkably that if you simply stop doing certain harmful things to it, it often recovers and becomes healthy all by itself.

> *"If you achieve all kinds of things in the material world, but you lose your health or your peace of mind, you get little or no pleasure from your other accomplishments."*

Tracy illustrates this with a story of a businessman who attended his seminar. When asked to imagine himself in perfect health, the man said he would run a marathon. His problem? He was forty years old, twenty pounds overweight, and not particularly fit. He doubted it was possible.

But the thought process had begun. The more he visualized himself as he could be rather than as he was, the more excited he became. He began seeing himself as lean and fit. He bought books on jogging, got proper running gear, and started with small distances, gradually increasing each week. Within one year, he ran his first 26.4-mile marathon, becoming the person he had imagined he could be.

### 3. Loving Relationships

The third ingredient is **loving relationships**—relationships with people you love and care about, and who love and care about you. These are the real measure of how well you are doing as a human being.

Most of your happiness and unhappiness in life comes from your relationships with others. It is your relationships that make you truly human. A key quality of a fully functioning person is the ability to enter into and maintain long-term friendships and intimate relationships.

Tracy offers a simple but profound test for measuring how well a relationship is going: **laughter.** How much two people laugh together is the surest measure of how well things are going. When a relationship is truly happy, people laugh a lot together. When it turns sour, the very first thing that goes is the laughter.

The same principle applies to organizations. High-performance, high-profit companies are those where people laugh and joke together, enjoy one another and their work. They function smoothly as teams, are more creative, more flexible, and more open to new ideas.

> *"I used to think that people were an important part of any business. Then I learned a great truth: people ARE the business."*

Without a clear idea of what you really want in a relationship, you will probably find yourself in situations not of your own choosing. Problems in life are almost invariably "people problems"—they come with hair on top and talk back. People problems do more to disrupt your peace of mind and undermine your health than perhaps any other factor.

One of your chief aims must be to create a human environment in which you can be happy, contented, and fulfilled. Examine your relationships one by one and develop a plan to make each of them enjoyable and satisfying.

### 4. Financial Freedom

The fourth ingredient is **financial freedom**—having enough money so that you don't worry about it continually, as most people do.

Tracy makes a powerful distinction:

> *"It is not money that lies at the root of all evil; it is lack of money."*

Achieving your own financial freedom is one of the most important goals and responsibilities of your life. It is far too important to be left to chance. Fully 80 percent of the population are preoccupied with money problems—thinking about money when they wake up, throughout the day, and during the evening. This is not a happy, healthy way to live.

While Tracy places financial freedom as number four on the list, he recognizes it is essential for achieving the first three ingredients. Most worry, stress, anxiety, and lost peace of mind are caused by money worries. Many health problems stem from financial stress. Many relationship problems and divorces are caused by arguments over money.

You owe it to yourself to develop your talents and abilities to the point where you can earn enough money so that you don't have to worry about it. A feeling of freedom is essential to achieving any other important goal, and you cannot be free until you have enough money that you are no longer preoccupied with it.

Imagine you had a magic wand and could design your financial life exactly as you wanted. What would it look like? How much would you like to be earning in one year, five years, ten years? How much would you like to have in the bank? How much would you like to be worth when you retire?

These are critically important questions that most people never ask themselves. But if you can be perfectly clear about where you want to go financially, you can learn what you need to know and do to get there.

### 5. Worthy Goals and Ideals

The fifth ingredient is **worthy goals and ideals.** According to psychologist Viktor Frankl, author of *Man's Search for Meaning*, perhaps your deepest subconscious drive is the need for meaning and purpose in life.

To be truly happy, you need:
- A clear sense of direction
- A commitment to something bigger and more important than yourself
- A feeling that your life stands for something
- A sense that you are making a valuable contribution to your world

Tracy quotes a profound definition:

> *"Happiness has been defined as 'the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.'"*

You can only be happy when you are working step by step toward something that is really important to you. Think about what sort of activities and accomplishments you most enjoy. What were you doing in the past when you were the happiest? What sort of activities give you your greatest sense of meaning and purpose?

---

### 6. Self-Knowledge and Self-Awareness

The sixth ingredient is **self-knowledge and self-awareness.** Throughout all of history, this has gone hand in hand with inner happiness and outer achievement. The phrase "Man, know thyself" traces back to ancient Greece.

To perform at your best, you need to:
- Know who you are and why you think and feel the way you do
- Understand the forces and influences that have shaped your character from earliest childhood
- Know why you react and respond the way you do to people and situations around you

It is only when you understand and accept yourself that you can begin moving forward in other areas of your life.

---

### 7. Personal Fulfillment

The seventh ingredient is a sense of **personal fulfillment**—the feeling that you are becoming everything you are capable of becoming. It is the sure knowledge that you are moving toward the realization of your full potential as a human being.

Psychologist Abraham Maslow called this "self-actualization." He said it was the primary characteristic of the healthiest, happiest, and most successful men and women in our society.

Tracy promises that his book will show you how to be your own psychologist—how to achieve and maintain a positive, optimistic, and cheerful mental attitude under almost all circumstances, and how to develop a fully integrated, fully functioning, fully mature personality.
